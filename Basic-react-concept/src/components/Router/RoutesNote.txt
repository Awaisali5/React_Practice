React Route:
1- routing refers to the process of navigating between different pages without triggering a full page reload. 
The application initially loads a single HTML page. Then, it dynamically renders different components based on user interaction.

2-React Does not have routing ability. you have to implement by using third party library 

React Router Dom library is use to implement the routing in react as it provide the client side rendering

PathConstants: An object that contains all page routes.

3-**routes: An array that includes the mappings between a route string and the page components

4-React lazy() fn allow us to render the larger portion into smallar portion and and render when
that pieace of info is required 
To make lazy-loaded components work, you need to render them through the <Suspense> component. Update <Layout> accordingly: 

5-Use fallback() which will show when the page is loading in the lazy load 



**Link Tag* : It is use in place of a (anchar tag: which refresh the page when click on it) alternative of a it prevent to page re-loaded
*NavLink* provide addtional thing : to use the call back function and variable in it to manipulate the thing


Path: Path where you are or willing to re-direct the user
element : name of the path like Home , contact us etc

Loader: to direct call the the fetch! fetch data and store it into cache 


RouterProvider is the wrapper that wrap the whole routing thing together 

CreateBrowerRouter: It is use to create the Brower Router in the react js
2- method
1-using the CreateBrowerRouter and pass the array of object
2-or CreateRouteFromElement  to create the rool 

Layout is use to define how the route are being nested together


**Hash Router** Store the url in the form of hash and we use it when we are using the shared resource or when we don't want to change the url 

**History Router** : it is unstable and it is use to store history of url

**Memory Router: it is best use case when you don't want to run on Brower and use it for the testing purpose 


*Static* To render the component on the server! Server side render

**native Router: to use it for the React Rative 


**Dynamic routing :
to add some parameter with route url like /user:id to send to a specfice id

#useParames() hook let to specfice that dynamic router functionailty : it will return the object 

UseNagivate is useful when you want to redirect user from unvalid url to home page

useparams() to store the data from the url like id=343 etc

useSearchParam to get the url data! how usestate work
