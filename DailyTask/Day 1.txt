Q1 : Props vs State:
Both states and props are use to manage data in React Component 

State: State are use to manage the internal data of the Component
2-it is an object which store data that are change within Component
3- when state changes, React re-render the updated data 
4-it is modified within the status it is being declare and cannot access by other component like props
5-The state can be initialized in the constructor of a component, and it can be updated using the setState() method.

props(property) is use to pass the data to the child component from the parent component
1-props are immutable(only read) and child component cannot modify it 
2-props are pass like attritube and can access using this keyword e.g this.props or this.name 
3-it is useful when the props when it receive data from the parent component 


Q2:
Use conditional rendering: 
Conditional rendering can help you control the display of your components based on certain conditions. 
This can be helpful for debugging
like if the condition is true apply certain rule and if the condition is false apply other rule
helpful in case of login page or session maintaining 

Q3: Composition in React Js?
Composition is use to combine the smallar, reusable component together to form a large, complex component
it involves building an application by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts and assembling them together like building blocks.

Here is another concept Nested component which help to form a hierarchy level of smallar component 
to make large and functional component like cards , productlist etc 


In ReactJS, Component Composition refers to the practice of creating reusable UI components by combining smaller components together. 
This allows developers to break down complex UIs into smaller,
more manageable parts, which can be easily reused across different parts of the application.


Q4: List and Key (render through Map function):
List and key are use to render data as the list of item such as array of object, string , number 
key are the unique identifer with is associated with each item in the list
