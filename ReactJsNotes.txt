**
Component are like function that are reusable
component ko diff jagah invoke|render|reuse kr sakty!
component:individual piece of re-usable code 
hierarchy of component to form UI
**
JSX (JavaScript XML) :it let us use html with javascript but it not the actually html. 
Babel convert jsx code into pure js

**
to create react app with vite@latest to create the react app
Npm install (to install node package) 

**
App Structure 

src : main functionailty of the app 
app component is the parent of all the components

index.index main page of the app -> main element which contain the root element and script with is connect 

main script: is use to render the app component in the root 

**Component **
component is the reusable and independent piece of code! writing component is like writing the function | class 

Render : can be treat as the html tag 

**Writing Markup in Jsx *
1- Return a single root element : wrap it into one root container or div
2- mostly in camelCase 
3-close all the tags <a /> : Babel looks for the closing tag

**React Fragment * : it lets to add a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM  <> </> to avoid the div ! extra nodes
like div create na ho tab hum react fragment use kr sakty hai 


JSX with curly bracket : {} to write the pure javascript logic into the JSX 


**part 2 **
React Props : props(property | argument )are the information that you pass to a JSX tag 
information pass kr sakty hai for the component through props 
props return the object 

**Passing Array as a props**
Array mai individual items print hoty hai 
object kay case mai direct render nahi krwa sakty we can render individual items with key 
we pass array and object directly into the props value 

**Rending the Array **
We have to convert each item in the list into a list item 
2 method 
1-Send array of element
2-wrap into the array using map 

**Conditonal** 
Adding element basic of some condition 
terney operator: if condition ? if true : if else 
e.g age >=18 : "Adult" : "Kid"
we can write condition with AND operator as well e.g if condition true && result(incase of true)
